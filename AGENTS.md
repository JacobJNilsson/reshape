# Instructions for AI Agents

Before making changes to this repository:

1. Read VISION.md
2. Read ARCHITECTURE.md
3. Read CONTRIBUTING_AI.md

These documents define:

- The purpose of reshape
- The architectural invariants
- The reasoning model expected when implementing features

Any change that violates these documents is considered incorrect,
even if tests pass.

If you are unsure where logic belongs, stop and reassess.
